<p>ANAHEIM -- <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/405395/albert-pujols">Albert Pujols</a> crushed his 610th career home run to become the <span class="token token-hyperLink" id="token-B6E5533F381B2C445F191"><a href="http://m.angels.mlb.com/news/article/250037522/">all-time leader</a></span> among foreign-born players as the Angels raced past the Rangers, 10-1, to even the four-game series between the American League West rivals on Tuesday night at Angel Stadium.</p>
<p>Pujols launched a three-run homer off Texas right-hander <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/643320/nick-gardewine">Nick Gardewine</a>, who was making his Major League debut, in the seventh inning to pass fellow Dominican Sammy Sosa and take sole possession of eighth place on the all-time list. The milestone blast capped a big night at the plate for the Angels, who remain a half-game behind the Twins for the second AL Wild Card spot.</p>

<div class="default-styles"><p>"It's pretty special," Pujols said. "To be able to accomplish something like this is very humbling."</p>

<p>The Angels banged out a season-high 16 hits, with every starter except for <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/592743/andrelton-simmons">Andrelton Simmons</a> collecting at least one. <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/592230/kaleb-cowart">Kaleb Cowart</a> homered and drove in three runs, while <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/594777/kole-calhoun">Kole Calhoun</a> finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs.</p>
<p>"We were taking good swings," Pujols said. "It seemed like every inning we got guys on base. We've been getting great at-bats. We're getting better breaks, hitting some balls hard and now they're falling."</p>
<figure class="poster has-video "><a class="video-link" data-video-id="1761361083" data-video-link="http://m.mlb.com/video/v1761361083" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v1761361083" title="TEX@LAA: Cowart on his three-run homer day, win"><img alt="Cowart on his three-run homer" src="http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/2017/08/23/images/mlbf_1761361083_th_45.jpg"/></a><div class="video-container"></div><figcaption class="meta-data video"><span class="headline">Cowart on his three-run homer </span><div class="stand-alone-blurb">TEX@LAA: Cowart on his three-run homer day, win</div><div class="blurb">Kaleb Cowart discusses his three-run homer in the bottom of the 5th inning that helped the Angels defeat the Rangers</div></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Rangers scored their lone run of the night in the fifth via a sacrifice fly from <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/462101/elvis-andrus">Elvis Andrus</a>.</p>
<p>Neither club got much length from its starting pitcher, as <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/445060/ricky-nolasco">Ricky Nolasco</a> and <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/475115/tyson-ross">Tyson Ross</a> both labored through their outings and were unable to make it past the fifth inning. Nolasco needed 101 pitches to get through 4 2/3 innings, surrendering one run on five hits while walking three and striking out six. Ross gave up three runs on seven hits with four walks and four strikeouts over 3 2/3 innings in a 98-pitch effort.</p>
<p>"Very challenging to find a rhythm," Rangers manager Jeff Banister said. "They were able to find some rhythm there at the plate but we were a bit challenged. We were [0-for-6] with runners in scoring position. We managed some baserunners but it's kind of been that nemesis of ours -- when offense gets tough for us we're incapable of getting a big hit."</p>
<p>The loss dropped the Rangers three games behind the Twins for the final AL playoff spot.</p>
<p><b>MOMENTS THAT MATTERED</b><br/>
<b>Calhoun knocks in two:</b> Ross weaved in and out of trouble all night, and the Angels finally chased him in the fourth inning after Calhoun doubled into the gap in right-center field to bring in a pair of runs and stake the Angels a 3-0 lead.</p>
<figure class="poster has-video "><a class="video-link" data-video-id="1760638183" data-video-link="http://m.mlb.com/video/v1760638183" href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v1760638183" title="TEX@LAA: Calhoun laces a clutch two-run double in 4th"><img alt="Calhoun's two-run double" src="http://mediadownloads.mlb.com/mlbam/2017/08/23/images/mlbf_1760638183_th_45.jpg"/></a><div class="video-container"></div><figcaption class="meta-data video"><span class="headline">Calhoun's two-run double </span><div class="stand-alone-blurb">TEX@LAA: Calhoun laces a clutch two-run double in 4th</div><div class="blurb">Kole Calhoun knocks a two-run double up the middle, scoring Kaleb Cowart and Mike Trout to make it a 3-0 game in the bottom of the 4th</div></figcaption></figure>
<p><b>Cowart pads the lead:</b> Cowart entered Tuesday with only three hits in his last 32 at-bats, but he showed signs of breaking out of his extended slump with two hits against the Rangers. After singling in the fourth, Cowart launched a three-run homer off <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/502212/austin-bibens-dirkx">Austin Bibens-Dirkx</a> to right field in the fifth, pushing the Angels' advantage to 6-1.</p>
<p>"I hit some balls hard in Seattle and unfortunately they didn't fall for hits," Cowart said. "I had a couple rough games on the road, but it's the same thing. Just getting better pitches to hit, swinging at the right ones and doing damage with them when I get them."</p>

<p><b>QUOTABLE</b><br/>
"One of the more memorable parts of the night is Nick Gardewine became a big leaguer tonight. He came in, got a bit unlucky, we were not able to make a play behind him. But I thought he threw the ball well, better than the numbers show." -- <em>Banister, on reliever Gardewine's Major League debut</em></p>
<p><b>REVERE DEPARTS</b><br/>
<a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/519184/ben-revere">Ben Revere</a> started in left field for the Angels, but he exited after fouling a ball off his left knee during his at-bat in the fourth inning. Revere initially remained in the game, but <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/457727/cameron-maybin">Cameron Maybin</a> pinch-hit for him in the fifth and then replaced him in left to start the sixth. Manager Mike Scioscia said Revere sustained a knee contusion and is day to day.</p>
<p><b>WHAT'S NEXT</b><br/>
<b>Rangers:</b> Texas will turn to right-hander <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/488768/andrew-cashner">Andrew Cashner</a> at 9:07 p.m. CT on Wednesday at Angel Stadium. Cashner is 4-2 with a 2.38 ERA over his last seven starts, logging quality starts in six of the outings..</p>
<p><b>Angels:</b> The Angels will send left-hander <a href="http://m.mlb.com/player/571760/andrew-heaney">Andrew Heaney</a> to the mound on Wednesday night as they continue their four-game set with the Rangers at 7:07 p.m. PT at Angel Stadium. Heaney, in his second outing since returning from Tommy John surgery, will make his first home start since April 5, 2016.</p>
