Without a quantitative measure of machine intelligence it is difficult to assess this claim, but there is no doubt that being able to implement pattern recognition and classification in a machine in a manner that enables it to distinguish objects, find profitable patterns in financial time series, teach itself how to play a game by examining the moves, identify subsequences in genome data, identify malicious behavior in networks, and detect fraudulent behavior in mortgage contracts would be a major advance in artificial intelligence and also a profitable one from a financial standpoint. Even if the machine required assistance from a human to do these tasks it would still be very useful. If it were able to do them on its own without any supervision one could justifiably describe it as being more intelligent than one that required such supervision (the counterexample to this imputation of intelligence is simple trial-and-error, which of course is unsupervised).<br><br>This book is a formal treatment of pattern recognition that is geared to a readership with a strong mathematical background and which makes as its major theme the difference between `supervised' and `unsupervised' pattern recognition, with this difference sometimes being more qualitative than what one would like. In the introduction to the book the authors make clear the distinction between these approaches, motivate the problem of the classification of features, and outline briefly the stages in the design of a pattern classification system. As is well known, supervised pattern recognition involves the use of training data, whereas unsupervised pattern recognition does not. In the latter case, it is left to the machine to find similarities in the feature vectors, and then cluster the similar feature vectors together. Researchers in the field of pattern recognition have devised an enormous number of algorithms and reasoning patterns to perform both unsupervised and supervised learning, and they have not necessarily developed these approaches in the context of machine intelligence. Thus the book could also be viewed as a mathematical theory of pattern recognition instead of one that is embedded in the field of artificial intelligence. However it is classified it is a useful and important work, and is well worth the time taken to read and study.<br><br>One of the most interesting (and esoteric) discussions is found in chapter 15 of the book. One of these concerns algorithms for `competitive learning' wherein representatives are designated and then "compete" with each other after a feature vector X is presented to the algorithm. The "winner" is the representative that is closer to X and the representatives are then updated by moving the winner toward X, with the rest remaining constant or move toward X at a slower rate. The competitive learning algorithm is parametrized by the learning rates of the winner and the losers, and the losers can have different learning rates. The investigator however selects the values of these parameters beforehand, and therefore competitive learning strictly speaking should not be classified as totally unsupervised. To be really unsupervised the competitive learning algorithm would have to make the selection of these parameters and tune them as needed to reach the convergence criterion. The authors do discuss briefly a version of the algorithm where the learning rate is variable, but the rate is still subject to certain constraints. Chapter 15 also contains a brief discussion of the use of genetic algorithms in clustering.<br><br>Another topic in the book that is both interesting and important and is still surprisingly unknown by many is that of `independent component analysis'. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a generalization of principal component analysis in that it tries to find a transformation that takes a feature vector into one whose components are mutually independent, instead of merely decorrelated. All of the random variables must be non-Gaussian in order for this technique to work, since the Gaussian case gives back the usual principal component analysis. Independent component analysis is beginning to be applied to many different areas, including finance, risk management, medical imaging, and physics. It remains to see whether it will become a standardized tool in the many mathematical and statistical software packages that exist at the present time. The authors discuss two different ways to perform independent component analysis, one being an approach based on higher order cumulants, and the other, interestingly, on mutual information. In the latter approach, the mutual information between the transformed components is calculated to be the Kullback-Leibler probability distance between the joint probability distribution of the transformed components and the product of the marginal probability densities. This distance is of course zero if the components are statistically independent. The strategy is then to find the transformational matrix that minimizes the mutual information, since this will make the components maximally independent. As the authors point out, the problem with this approach is that the elements of the transformation matrix are hidden in the marginal probability distribution functions of the transformed variables. They then outline an approach that allows them to calculate the mutual information with the assumption that the transformation matrix is unitary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></div><div class="a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header"><div class="a-expander-content-fade"></div><a class="a-declarative" data-a-expander-toggle='{"allowLinkDefault":true, "expand_prompt":"Read more", "collapse_prompt":"Read less"}' data-action="a-expander-toggle" data-hook="expand-collapse-read-more-less" href="javascript:void(0)"><i class="a-icon a-icon-extender-expand"></i><span class="a-expander-prompt">Read more</span></a></div></div></span></div>, <div class="a-row a-spacing-top-small review-comments" data-hook="review-comments"><a class="a-link-normal" href="/gp/customer-reviews/R3A1E19F6Q6VUL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_btm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1597492728#wasThisHelpful"><span class="review-comment-total aok-hidden">0</span><span class="a-size-base" data-hook="review-comment">Comment</span></a><span class="a-letter-space"></span><i aria-label="|" class="a-icon a-icon-text-separator"><span class="a-icon-alt">|</span></i><span class="a-letter-space"></span><span class="a-size-base cr-vote" data-hook="review-voting-widget"><span class="cr-vote-buttons cr-vote-component"><span class="a-color-secondary"><span class="review-votes" data-hook="helpful-vote-statement">
